Since the short text, randomness and a large amount of noise make the traditional 
	
methods of topic detection can not be solved to get the new topic, and this topic 

detection techniques have not considered the time factor of the microblog post.

In this paper, the microblog topic detection method based on clustering ensemble 

is proposed for the characteristics of micro-blog and topic dynamic performance.

 This method considers the nonlinear time factor of microblog post, the improved 

 K-Means methods is used to construct the corresponding base cluster based on each 

 feature of microblog, evaluate the effectiveness and difference between the each cluster, 

 so as to set up the ensemble weights and the clustering ensemble is used for microblog topic detection.

  Experiments on real microblog data show that the proposed method get a accuracy up to 9.5% 

in microblog topic detection, which can detect the new topic more
